About this Repository
=====================

ComputerCraft was originally released in late 2011 by [Daniel Ratcliffe](https://twitter.com/DanTwoHundred). In early 2017, after working on the mod solo for five years, it was decided to release the source code publicly to allow Dan to devote time to other projects.

Later a version named [Computality](https://github.com/NoMansMinecraft/Computality) was created, to support Minecraft 1.10+. However, the 1.10 version crashed upon any items being inserted into a turtle inventory, and the author has indicated he does not consider bug fixes on that version to be a priority, so I've forked it to fix the bugs myself.
